to start with this topic, I would love to share my current experience regarding Microsoft certifications.

My start within the whole "certification game" was in 2021, when my former supervisor introduced the "Microsoft Virtual Training Days". 
This MS event is a virtual based online meeting, where you had the chance to learn about different Microsoft topics. 
The training days, which took around 2-3 days, were mainly focused on Azure topics.<br>
What I personally liked about the Virtual Training Days, was that you would receive a voucher for a free Microsoft exam regarding this topic.
With this option, I was able to do the following certifications:
- Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)
- Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900)
- Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900)
- Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals (PL-900)
- Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fundamentals (MB-901)

This led me later due to often Exchange OnPrem and Exchange Online tasks to the following certification:
- Microsoft Messaging Administrator Associate (MS-203)

## Applied Skills Certifications
Microsofts new "Applied Skills" certifications are a great alternative for "non-exam learners". <br>
I've already taken my first applied skills exam on "Administer Active Directory Domain Services", which was a totally new experience.<br>
While back then, when you had to really learn hard for "exam knowledge", you now have the option of using more reality-based skills.
The main difference is that you will complete the applied skills exams in a live demo lab with real VMs and stuff, which is a way better possibility of testing someone's knowledge.<br>
I like this idea really, since this is closer on real life experience, then exam questions only.

> [!NOTE]
> About a half year ago, Microsoft introduced into "Applied Skills Certifications".
> Due to its age, the certifications are very poor regarding topics, knowledge and of reputation. I'll hope, this will change within the next months.

> Furthermore I want to share the [Microsoft Event Calendar](https://events.microsoft.com/en-us/allevents/?language=English&clientTimeZone=1?timeperiod=next30Days?isSharedInLocalViewMode=false) with the possibility to join hundreds of Microsoft events, lectures and presentation from Microsoft or partners.


## Was there any benefit for me? Was it worth it?
personally regarding my current certifications, I really think, that there was a **great benefit** for me and my personal grow, as well as my career.
I've been already to multiple job interviews where the number of certifications were a topic for discussion, or at least a positive feedback.
Also, in some cases, I could really learn some things for my daily job.
