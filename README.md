# Welcome to IrgendwasMitSchnittlauch's Blog
Hey, my name is Florian, I'm built 2002 and this will be my personal blog.

You might ask yourself: _'a blog based on markdown files, published in a github repos only? Are you serious?'_ 

The answer is simple: **yes.**

I will try this project of personal public documentation for a few weeks now and will then decide on how to proceed with the project.

## Who is this dude, who publishes blog posts in github .md files?

I'm a german based IT system engineer specialiced in microsoft tech. I'm mainly working with Azure, PowerShell and Windows Server. Im very excited to always learn new technologies.

Originally I had my own wix hosted blog, which was kinda fun *(design, layouts, features etc.)* but was way too annoying regarding loading times, GDPR and legal stuff. I had to shut down my blog in the begin of 2022 to reduce the amount of headache regarding the whole blog topic. The topics I've discussed, written down and saved were all similar to personal powershell automations, my personal growth aswell as my ms certification path.

Now about 2,5 years later, I decided to take a restart and get to start again with my already gained experience this new project.
